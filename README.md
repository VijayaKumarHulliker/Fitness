=>Design Choices
1.UI/UX: The design closely follows the Figma mockups provided, ensuring consistency across different screen sizes. Padding, margins, and font sizes were carefully adjusted to match the designs.
2.Responsiveness: The app uses a combination of MediaQuery and Flexible widgets to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices.
3.Error Handling: Implemented error handling for image loading to provide a smooth user experience even if an image fails to load.
=>Challenges
1.Firebase Integration: One of the challenges was correctly integrating Firebase with the Flutter app, especially handling real-time data updates and ensuring that the app responds well to network changes.
2.Responsive Design: Ensuring that the UI elements were responsive and looked good on different screen sizes was another challenge, especially for complex layouts.
3.Performance Optimization: Loading data and images efficiently from Firebase while maintaining smooth scrolling and transitions was a key focus.
